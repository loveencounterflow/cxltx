## What is it? And Why?

Everyone who has worked with LaTeX knows how hard it can often be to get seemingly simple things done in
this Turing-complete markup language. Let's face it, (La)TeX has many problems; the [complectedness](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)
of its inner workings and the extremely uneven syntax of its commands put a heavy burden on the average
user.

The funny thing is that **while TeX is all about computational text processing, doing math and
string processing are often really hard to get right** (not to
mention that TeX has no notion of higher-order data types, such as, say, lists).

Often one wishes one could just do a simple calculation or build a typesetting object from available data
*outside* of all that makes LaTeX so difficult to get right. Turns out you can already do that, and you
don't have to recompile TeX.

Most of the time, running TeX means to author a source file and have the TeX executable convert that into
a PDF. Of course, this implies reading and writing of files and executing binaries. Interestingly for us, both
capabilities—file access and command execution—are made available to user-facing side of TeX: writing to
a file happens via the `\write` command, while input from a file is done with `\input`; command execution
repurposes `\write`, which may be called with the special stream number `18` (internally, TeX does almost
everything with registers that are sometimes given symbolic names; it also enumerates 'channels' for file
operations, and reserves #18 for writing to the command line and executing stuff). This is how the `\exec`
command is (in essence) defined in `coffeexelatex.sty`:

    \newcommand{\CXLTXtempOutRoute}{/tmp/coffeexelatex.tex}

    \newcommand{\exec}[1]{%
      \immediate\write18{#1 > \CXLTXtempOutRoute}
      \input{\CXLTXtempOutRoute}
      }

With some TeXs, its possible to avoid the temporary file by using `\@@input|"dir"`, but XeTeX as
provided by TeXLive 2013 does not allow that. The temporary file does have an advantage:
in case TeX should halt execution because of an error, and that error is due to a script
with faulty output, you can conveniently review the problematic source by opening the temporary file in
your text editor.

Besides `\exec`, there is also `\execdebug` which captures the `stderr` output of a
command and renders it in red to the document in case any output occurred there.


## TeX and NodeJS

### Method One: Spawning a `node` process

The whole idea of CXLTX is to have some external program receive data from inside a running TeX invocation,
process that data, and pass the result back to TeX.

The command given to `\exec` could be anything; for our purposes, we will concentrate on running
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) programs. The simplest thing is to have NodeJS evaluate a JavaScript expression
and print out the result; the `\evaljs` command has been defined to do just that:

    \newcommand{\evaljs}[1]{\execdebug{node -p "#1"}}

    % will insert `16 * 3 = 48` in TeX math mode (triggered by `$`):
    $ 16 * 3 = \evaljs{16 * 3} $

This technique is easily adapted to work with [CoffeeScript]{http://coffeescript.org} (or any other language
that compiles to JS):

    \newcommand{\evalcs}[1]{\execdebug{coffee -e "console.log #1"}}

    % will insert `[1,4,9]`
    \evalcs{ ( n * n for n in [ 1, 2, 3 ] ) }

Of course, evaluating one-liners will give you only so much power, so why not execute more sizeable
programs? That's what `\nodeRun` is for:

    \usepackage[abspath]{currfile}
    \newcommand{\CXLTXmainRoute}{../../lib/main}
    \newcommand{\nodeRun}[2]{
      \exec{node "\CXLTXmainRoute" "\currfileabsdir" "\jobname" "#1" "#2"}}

    % will insert `Hello, world!`
    \nodeRun{helo}{world}

`\NodeRun` will run NodeJS with the following arguments:
**(1)** the route to our custom-made executable;
**(2)** the route to the parent directory where the currently processed TeX source files are;
**(3)** the current job name;
**(4)** a command name (first argument to `\nodeRun`); and, lastly,
**(5)** optional command arguments (second argument to `\nodeRun`).

Observe that you may want to define your own routes in case the default values do not match your needs;
these can be easily done using `\renewcommand`:

    \renewcommand{\CXLTXmainRoute}{../../lib/main}
    \renewcommand{\CXLTXtempOutRoute}{/tmp/CXLTXtempout.tex}
    \renewcommand{\CXLTXtempErrRoute}{/tmp/CXLTXtemperr.tex}

### Method Two: Spawning `curl`

Spawning a subprocess to 'outsource' a computing task is certainly not the cheapest or fastest way—creating
and taking down a process is relatively costly. More specifically, spawning `node` is both comparatively
expensive (in terms of memory) and slow. Also, the subprocess must run on the same machine as the main
process, and unless it persisted some data (in a DB or in a file), the subprocess will run in a stateless
fashion. What's more obvious than to make TeX communicate with a long-running HTTP server?

Now i've not heard of any way to make TeX issue an HTTP request on its own behalf. But we already know we
can issue arbitrary command lines, so we certainly can spawn `curl localhost` to communicate with a
local or remote server. We still have to spawn a subprocess, but maybe `curl` is both lighter and faster
than `node`? It certainly is.

Here are some timings i obtained for running our simple echoing example, once spawning `node`, and once
spawning `curl`. The server is a very simple [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application; except for the
command line argument and HTTP parameter handling, the same code is ultimately executed:

    time node "cxltx/lib/main" "cxltx/doc/" "cxltx-manual" \
      "helo" "friends" \
      > "/tmp/CXLTXtempout.tex" 2> "/tmp/CXLTXtemperr.tex"

    real  0m0.140s
    real  0m0.082s
    real  0m0.083s

    time curl --silent --show-error \
      127.0.0.1:8910/foobar.tex/cxltx-manual/helo/friends \
      > "/tmp/CXLTXtempout.tex" 2> "/tmp/CXLTXtemperr.tex"

    real  0m0.010s
    real  0m0.011s
    real  0m0.010s

In so far these rather naïve benchmarks can be trusted, they would indicate that fetching the same
insignificant amount of data via `curl` from a local server is around ten times as performant as doing the
same thing by spawning `node`. The reason for this is partly attributable to the considerable size of the NodeJS
binary (respectively whatever actions are taken by NodeJS to ready itself).

Even doing `time node -p "1"`
results in execution times of over 0.07s. Add to this the `curl` timings of around 0.01s, and you roughly get the
0.08s needed to spawn `node` and get results—in other words, `curl` itself seems to be quite fast.

The upshot of this is that using our first method we can call external code at a frequency around 10 per
second, but using the `curl` method, we can get closer to almost 100 per second (depending on the machine
etc). The difference might matter if you plan to put out a *lot* of external calls, and since the
typical way of getting TeX source code right is running and re-running TeX a lot of times, doing it faster
may help greatly.

### Security Considerations

Be aware that executing arbitrary code with a command line like

    xelatex --enable-write18 --shell-escape somefile.tex

is inherently unsafe: a TeX file downloaded from somewhere could erase your disk, access your email, or
install a program on your computer. This is what the `--enable-write18` switch is for: it is by default fully
or partially disabled so an arbitrary TeX source gets limited access to your computer.

If you're scared now, please hang on a second. I just want to tell you *you should be really, really scared*.
Why? Because if you ever downloaded some TeX source to compile it on your machine **even without the
`--enable-write18` switch** you've already **executed potentially harmful code**. Few people are aware of
it, but many TeX installations are quite 'liberal' in respect to what TeX sources—TeX programs, really—are
allowed to do *even in absence of command line switches*, and, as a result, even people who are hosting
public TeX installations for a living are susceptible to malicious code.*

**It is a misconception that TeX source is 'safe' because 'TeX is text-based format'** (how stupid is that,
anyway?); **the truth is that by doing `latex xy.tex` you're executing code which may do malicious things**.
Period. That said, the papers linked below make it quite clear that `--enable-write18` just 'opens the barn
door', as it were, but in fact, there are quite a few other and less well known avenues for TeX-based
malware to do things on your computer.

And please don't think you're safe just because you're not executing
anything but your own TeX source—that, in case you're using LaTeX, is highly improbable: any given real-world
LaTeX document will start with a fair number of `\usepackage{}` statements, and each one of those refers to
a source that is publicly accessible on the internet and has been so for maybe five or ten or more years.
Someone might even have managed to place a mildly
useful package on CTAN, one that has some obfuscated parts designed to take over world leadership on
Friday, 13th—who knows? **The fact that TeX is a programming language that works by repeatedly re-writing
itself does not exactly help in doing static code analysis**; in fact, such code is called
'[metamorphic code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_code)' and is a well-known technique employed
by computer viruses.

I do not write this section of the present README to scare you away, just to inform whoever is concerned
of a little known fact of life. The gist of this is: don't have `--enable-write18` turned on except you
know what you're doing, but be aware that running TeX has always been unsafe anyway.

## Related Work

* [**PyTeX**](http://www.pytex.org/) (also dubbed QATeX) is a laudable effort that has, sadly, been stalling for around 11 years as
  of this writing (January 2014), so it is likely pretty much outdated. PyTeX's approach is apparently the
  opposite of what we do in CXLTX: they run TeX in daemon mode from Python, where we have NodeJS start a server
  that listens to our independently running TeX.—Just for giggles, a quote from the above page: "XML is hard work to key by hand.
  *It lacks the mark-up minimization that SGML has*" (my emphasis). Well, eleven years is a long time.

* [**PythonTeX**](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex) is an interesting approach to bringing LaTeX and Python
  together. Unfortunately, the authors are preconcerned with showing off Pygment's syntax hiliting
  capabilities (which are ... not really that great) and how to print out integrals using SymPy; sadly, they fail
  to provide sample code of interest to a wider audience. Their copious 128-page manual only dwells for one and a half page on the topic
  of 'how do i use this stuff', and that only to show off more SymPy capabilities. None of their sample
  code *needs* PythonTeX anyway, since none of it demonstrates how to interact with the document typesetting
  process; as such, all their formulas and plots may be produced offline, independently from LaTeX.
  Given that the installation instructions are too scary and longwinded for my taste, and that PythonTeX is
  not part of LiveTeX, i've given up on the matter.

(the below taken from http://get-software.net/macros/latex/contrib/pythontex):

* [**SageTeX**](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sagetex) allows code for the Sage
  mathematics software to be executed from within a \LaTeX\ document.

* Martin R. Ehmsen's [**`python.sty`**](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/python) provides a very basic method of
  executing Python code from within a LaTeX document.

* [**SympyTeX**](http://elec.otago.ac.nz/w/index.php/SympyTeX) allows more sophisticated Python execution, and
  is largely based on a subset of SageTeX.

* [**LuaTeX**](http://www.luatex.org/) extends the pdfTeX engine to provide Lua as an embedded scripting
  language, and as a result yields tight, low-level Lua integration.

  LuaTeX is one of the most interesting projects in this field as it represents an attempt to provide a
  close coupling of a real programming language with LaTeX. Unfortunately, that language is Lua, whose designers
  believe that Unicode strings should be stored as UTF-8 bytes (Go does the same, btw). Equally unfortunately,
  LuaTeX uses pdfTeX, which can't compare to XeLaTeX when it comes to using custom TTF/OTF fonts.


## Sample Command Lines

To make it easier for TeX to resolve `\usepackage{cxltx}`, put a symlink to your CXLTX directory into
a directory that is on LaTeX's search path. On OSX with LiveTeX, that can be achieved by doing

    cd ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex
    ln -s route/to/cxltx cxltx

Here is what i do to build `cxltx/cxltx-manual.pdf`:

**(1)** use [Pandoc](http://http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc) to convert `README.md` to `README.tex`:

    pandoc -o cxltx/doc/README.tex cxltx/README.md

**(2)** copy the `aux` file from the previous TeX compilation step to preserve its data for CXLTX to see:

    cp cxltx/doc/cxltx-manual.aux cxltx/doc/cxltx-manual.auxcopy

**(3)** compile `cxltx-manual.tex` to `cxltx-manual.pdf`
  (`--enable-write18`: allows to access external programs form within TeX;
  `--halt-on-error`: is a convenience so i don't have to type `x` on each TeX error;
  `--recorder`: needed by the `currfile` package to get absolute routes):

    xelatex \
      --output-directory cxltx/doc \
      --halt-on-error \
      --enable-write18 \
      --recorder \
      cxltx/doc/cxltx-manual.tex

**(4)** move the pdf file to its target location:

    mv cxltx/doc/cxltx-manual.pdf cxltx
